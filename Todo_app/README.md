# To-do app
This was my first project towards python & django.\
It is totaly based on CRUD operations.\
At a time any one can create, update, read and delete task.\

### Language used:
* Frontend : HTML, css, Bootstrap, JS
* Backend : python, Django
* DB : SQLite

### Future Update:
* I want to make this preoject usefull for small organization.
* I will add user restriction and user specific task.
* ex: User can read task only. they restricted to edit or delete task and user can only see task which will assign to perticular user.
* I will impliment function to attach file with task for both user and admin. so that both can attach important file.
* It also required comment option both side.
* So after completing perticular task which was assign to user. user upload file and also add comments.

At that time I have thought about this update only. If have any suggetions then let's have cup of coffee.\
